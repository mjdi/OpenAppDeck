# OpenAppDeck
Visual App Icon Grid (inspired by Vimium + Elgato Stream Deck) task switcher enhancement middleware for PowerToys Run
- more easily switch between up to 40 open windows with a 4x10 app grid layout which intuitively compliments your keyboard!
- Note: Currently maps to number row + Colemak DH layout (easily changed in app.py or later in the config files when I refactor the code)
- default hotkey to open OpenAppDeck is `win+backspace` (as this was easy on my split ergonomic keyboard)
  - I would also suggest changing it to `alt+space` (PowerToysRun's default hotkey) in `hotkey.py`

## Non-Python requirements
PowerToys (up to date is best)

## Installation and Running
```
git clone https://github.com/mjdi/OpenAppDeck.git
cd OpenAppDeck
virtualenv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python hotkey.py
```

## Why does it require Admin privileges?
As shown in the demo, hotkey.py will ask for admin privileges in order to swap to/away from other admin windows

## ToDo:
- get `hotkey.py` to run at startup and auto-minimize the python/cmd window that appears
- move all hardcoded values to a config file (to avoid committing them every time they change)
- improve the rendering speed (perhaps use smaller images/icons), improve window title extraction logic
- improve text formatting and user interface, test with more types of apps, downloading more icons to fill gaps
- disable remaining buttons that don't have an associated app, find/fix more bugs that are created/discoverd later
- figure out a way to disambiguate Windows Explorer windows (default image since they are ambiguously titled after directory)
